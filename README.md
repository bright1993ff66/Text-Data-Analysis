# Text Data Analysis

## 1. Description

Here I mainly use Python to do some downstream natural language processing tasks.

## 2. My interests?

- NLP based representation learning such as learning the word vectors
- Application of language model to other related fields such as recommender system

# 3. Some papers
- Word representations
1. [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf)
2. [Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf)
3. [How to generate good word embedding?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05523.pdf)

- NLP and recommender system
1. [NLP-based Course Clustering and Recommendation](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i256/f09/Final%20Projects%20write-ups/Suzuki_Park_project_final.pdf)
2. [Deep Learning based Recommender System: A Survey and New Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07435.pdf)

# 4. Tools I always use
1. [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)
2. [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)
3. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
4. [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
