# Description

Here I will do some Chinese document classification based on a real-world dataset.

The dataset can be found in here [Sogou Labs](http://www.sogou.com/labs/resource/list_pingce.php). The dataset I use is a news dataset which includes all the news from June 2012 to July 2012. All the news have been categorized into 18 different topics. Our task here is to create a machine learning model to classify an incoming news and send it to the correct category.
