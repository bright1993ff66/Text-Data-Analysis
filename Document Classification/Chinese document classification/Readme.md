# Description

Here I will do some Chinese document classification based on a real-world dataset.

The dataset can be found in here [THUCTC](http://thuctc.thunlp.org/), which is made by Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science Lab, Tsinghua University. The dataset is huge so I will only select three categories of text data and do the document classification.
